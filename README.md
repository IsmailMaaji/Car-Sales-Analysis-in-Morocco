### Project Overview
Explain the primary objective of the project:

#### Objective:
To analyze car sales across different cities in Morocco, providing key insights such as total revenue, average price, sales distribution by city, and consumer preferences in terms of transmission and engine types.

#### Key Metrics:
- Total Revenue: 3.54 billion dirhams
- Average Price: 142.9K dirhams
- Total Models Analyzed: 368
- Cities Analyzed: 191
  


## Data Sources:

### Data Sources:
- Car sales data across Moroccan cities for various brands, including price, engine type, transmission, and sales figures.
-  Link to the dataset source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data).
  
### Data Processing:
- Used Power BI to clean and preprocess the raw data.
- Handled missing values, ensured uniformity in units, and created calculated fields for metrics like total revenue, average price, and city-specific sales totals.

  
### Data Fields:
- Marque (Brand): The car brand (e.g., Renault, Mercedes-Benz).
- City: Cities in Morocco (e.g., Casablanca, Rabat).
- Price: Car prices per city.
- Transmission Type: Manual or automatic.
- Engine Type: Diesel, petrol, electric, hybrid.



### Tools and Technologies Used

#### Power BI:
- Used for visualizing the data, creating slicers/filters, and building the dashboard.
- Features like DAX were used for calculated fields such as total revenue, average price, etc.
#### Excel:
- Used for initial data cleaning and exploration before importing into Power BI.


## Methodology
In this section, describe the step-by-step process you followed to conduct the analysis.

- Data Import: Imported the cleaned data into Power BI.
- Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.
- Calculations:
Total Revenue: Created a DAX measure to sum the revenue for each brand and city.
Average Price: Calculated the average selling price across all cars in the dataset.
- Creating Visualizations:
- Revenue Cards: Displayed the overall total revenue and average price using KPI cards.
- Table (Car Sales by City): Showed a breakdown of city-wise revenue for different car brands.
- Map: Plotted sales data on a map to visualize geographical distribution.
- Transmission and Engine Type Pie Charts: Showed consumer preferences in terms of engine and transmission types.
- Bar Chart (Top-Selling Models): Highlighted the best-selling models in terms of units sold.
